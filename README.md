## Overview

This repository contains a specialized study on **Real Estate Marketing Strategy**, developed for the course **“Analysis and Design of Information Systems”** at the **University of West Attica (UNIWA)**.

The project analyzes the systematic procedures involved in **real estate marketing**, utilizing structured modeling techniques to describe the professional interaction between the **Real Estate Agent** and the **Client**.

## Methodologies Used

The documentation employs the following industry-standard system modeling techniques to provide a complete and structured view of the real estate marketing process:

- **B1 – Verbal Analysis**  
  A detailed, text-based description of the real estate marketing procedure, outlining all steps, actors, and decision points.

- **B2 – Use Case Analysis (UML Use Cases)**  
  UML-based use case diagrams illustrating system functionality from the initial client request to the completion and logging of the transaction.

- **B3 – Organizational Entities (OEs)**  
  Identification and analysis of organizational roles involved in the process, including:
  - Client  
  - Real Estate Agent  

- **B4 – Functional Decomposition**  
  Breakdown of the overall system functionality into smaller, manageable sub-functions to clarify responsibilities and system behavior.

- **B5 – Process Decomposition**  
  Decomposition of the real estate marketing workflow into sequential and interrelated processes, highlighting process flow and dependencies.

- **B6 – IDEF3 Workflow Diagram**  
  Modeling of the operational workflow, focusing on process sequencing and execution logic.

- **B7 – IDEF3 State Transition Diagram**  
  Representation of system state changes throughout the lifecycle of a real estate marketing request.

- **B8 – Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**  
  Visualization of how data is generated, processed, stored, and transferred within the system.

- **B9 – IDEF0 Diagram**  
  Functional modeling of the system, emphasizing:
  - Inputs (Client Identification, Property Information)  
  - Outputs  
  - Controls (Agency Policy, Legal Regulations)  
  - Mechanisms (Property Database, Real Estate Agent)

- **B10 – Entity Relationship (E–R) Model**  
  Conceptual data model defining entities, attributes, and relationships required to support the real estate marketing process.

## The Marketing Process

The core system is based on the interaction between two primary entities:

- **Client**
- **Real Estate Agent**

The workflow includes the following key steps:

1. **Client Request**  
   The process begins when a client requests professional real estate marketing services.

2. **Identity & Property Validation**  
   The agent verifies the client’s identity and confirms property ownership and details.

3. **Database Verification**  
   Existing records are checked to ensure consistency and eligibility.

4. **Policy Compliance**  
   The request is evaluated against agency standards and legal requirements.

5. **Finalization**  
   - If all checks succeed:  
     - The transaction is logged  
     - The marketing phase is initiated  
   - Otherwise:  
     - The request is rejected or returned for correction
